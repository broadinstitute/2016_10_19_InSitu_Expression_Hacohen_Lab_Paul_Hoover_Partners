"# There are a lot more categories this time so we're going to try the classifications using >= and < for now. We could also use some sort of weighted average, where the bin in each channel is accounted or in a final classification of each cell. Myeloid_all has only one filter because it can and should have overlapping channel signal from the other three channels.",,,,
